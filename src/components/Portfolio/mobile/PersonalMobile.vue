      <p>In summer semester 2017 I was able to get my first experience with university.
        <br>I participated in the project "Studieren vor dem Abitur" by the Heinrich-Heine University in DÃ¼sseldorf.
        <br>There I took a physics class with the topic of theoretical mechanics. I attended the lectures and exercises and did
        <br>my best following along despite the high prerequisites in mathematics and physics.
