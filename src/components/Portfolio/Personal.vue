      In summer semester 2017 I was able to get my first experience with university.
      I participated in the project "Studieren vor dem Abitur" by the Heinrich-Heine University in DÃ¼sseldorf.
      There I took a physics class with the topic of theoretical mechanics. I attended the lectures and exercises and did
      my best following along despite the high prerequisites in mathematics and physics.

      Further I had the opportunity to take part of the internship "Projekt Quantenmechanik" at the Technical University of Dortmund.
      There I executed and documented experiences with lasers, gases and electricity with the goal to understand quantum physics.

      As I am interested in how education transforms and what impact education has on our society,
      I have been engaged my own in helping students with their educational careers.
      I did volunteer work at my school, as part of an internship and in my freetime as a private tutor.
