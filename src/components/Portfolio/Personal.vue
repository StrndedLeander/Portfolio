              In summer semester 2017 I was able to get my first experience with university.
              I participated in the project "Studieren vor dem Abitur" by the Heinrich-Heine University in DÃ¼sseldorf.
              There I took a physics class with the topic of theoretical mechanics. I attended the lectures and exercises and did
              my best following along despite the high prerequisites in mathematics and physics.
